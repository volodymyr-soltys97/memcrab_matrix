The project is intended as a demonstration of managing complex state and rendering in a React application.

## Features

 + Increment Cell Values: Click on any cell to increase its value by 1.
 + Add Rows: Dynamically add new rows to the matrix.
 + Remove Rows: Remove existing rows with a single click.
